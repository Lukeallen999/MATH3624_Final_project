# MATH3624 - Mathematical Finance in Context Final year project

## Description
This project was initially developed in 2021 as part of my final-year project for the Mathematical Finance in Context module. I collaborated with two fellow students, Frazer Birch and Jaxom Dunn, under the supervision of Dr. Alessandro Cardinali. The data for the project was sourced by Dr. Cardinali from Yahoo Finance, and it consisted of daily price quotes for four major US equity market sectors. These sectors were:
- Healthcare
- Consumer Services
- Financial Services
- Real Estate

###  Aim
The aim of this project was to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the US equity market. We sought to demonstrate that the negative effects of the pandemic could be mitigated, or even leveraged for profit, by exploiting the performance similarities (correlations) among the selected equity sectors. Using statistical analysis, we calculated these correlations over the chosen time period and used them to construct a portfolio that delivered positive performance during the pandemic.

## Notes
I uploaded this project to GitHub a few years after completing it, which means there is no version control, and all the files have the same upload date.
